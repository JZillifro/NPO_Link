   "address": "1008 Mission Street",
   "description": "Since its founding in 1999, Oasis For Girls has provided life skills, arts, and leadership training for at-risk, low-income girls of color and immigrant girls throughout San Francisco. Our mission is to partner with under-resourced girls and young women to help them discover opportunities and explore their dreams. Our youth-development programs provide a safe space to cultivate the skills, knowledge, and confidence to build strong futures for themselves and their communities. At Oasis, girls learn to make healthy decisions, explore the world and themselves, and discover their full potential. \n\nAt Oasis For Girls, our work is intended to support the \"whole girl.\" Methodologically, we strive to provide extended connections and multiple modes of activity designed to build on one another through repetition and the development of incremental and complementary skills and experiences, while fostering a sense of collective identity as \"Oasis girls.\" This extended contact and sequential skills-building provides girls and young women with enduring opportunities to develop trusting relationships with positive, supportive adults, develop a sense of collective identity and partnership, and engage in an extended period of skills-development and practice.\n\nTypically, the activities of our core sequence - the Springboard Series for Girls - operate on a one-year cycle, although girls may choose to extend or modify this course offering. Throughout the year, girls develop multiple positive pathways to future success:\n\nA foundation of life skills, critical thinking, and emotional and interpersonal literacy; academic, basic technological, and transferable job readiness skills to support academic and professional development;\n\nExpressive capacity through arts creation; education into cultural history and the power of movement building; \n\nPeer support and cross-identity learning that cultivates positive solidarity with other females across age, culture, and divisive identities; \n\nExposure to broadened cultural horizons and networks of connections through arts, education, mentors, and adult allies.\n\nOur Theory of Change & Primary Strategy: Oasis For Girls recognizes that girls and young women who face social, familial, cultural, and academic challenges need practical and psychological support from trusted and consistent adult allies, delivered within a peer-based culture of care and reciprocal support. \n\nWe believe that low-income girls and girls of color can achieve autonomy and satisfaction in their personal, academic, and professional lives when engaged in extended, multi-modal, culturally relevant and developmentally appropriate activities in a supportive environment. \n\nTherefore, our primary strategy is to provide girls with broad and ongoing exposure to multiple vocational, cultural, and academic opportunities coupled with training in personal and interpersonal skills, delivered in a safe, culturally relevant space that emphasizes autonomy, relationship-building, and positive decision-making. \n\nThe staff-to-participant ratio allows the development of trusting personal connections between staff and participants, while the limited number of participants allows the development of strong peer relationships and a common culture. \n\nWe operate year-round during out-of-school times (after school, school breaks, and summer vacation), coordinating with the calendar of the San Francisco Unified School District. Our budget for 2012 is $388,270.31.\n\nWho We Serve: Oasis focuses on low-income high-school-aged immigrant girls and girls of color, generally ages 14-17, from throughout San Francisco. In general, Oasis strives to serve two categories of girls: Those who are \"on the edge\" of risk and those who are \"off the radar\" - unnoticed, not obviously troublesome, but disengaged and under-supported.\n\nIn screening applicants, Oasis strives to identify girls and young women who are ready to benefit from the opportunities and services that core to Oasis's work. In rare cases, candidates with greater needs, more complex behaviors, or developmental delays are referred to other organizations that are better suited to meet their needs.\n\nIn order to foster peer learning and cultivate participants' abilities to positively interact with multiple \"types\" of girls, Oasis intentionally cultivates a mix of four sub-populations: \n\n1. Girls who are striving, relatively high achievers who carry excessive sense of burden;\n\n2. Girls who may be considered socially awkward, disconnected, or loners; \n\n3. Girls who tend to be quiet and compliant but who are not engaged in positive programs that extend their \ncapacities; \n\n4. Girls who may be dabbling in difficulty to some degree but might readily respond to positive environments.",

This increases crop yields and improves nutrition. We assist local farm families with planting, \n\nImprove: We improve infant and pre-school children's diets by administering an improved porridge feeding program. Made from QPM and pinches of barley malt, this combination has been proven to alleviate malnutrition, thwart sickness, and keep children in school so they can continue their education.\n\nEmpower: We provide micro-credit loans for women to start small scale businesses. This availability of credit empowers women and increases their income - because they do not have access to traditional financing.\n\nCooperate: We cooperate with other organizations and agencies in the introduction of appropriate farming practices or advancement in the battle against poverty and malnutrition.",

These forest hotspots have as little as 10 percent of their original forest habitat remaining, yet are home to at least 1,500 plant species found nowhere else in the world. The Eastern Arc Mountains and Coastal Forests are globally important for their biodiversity values; nationally important as the water catchment areas of Eastern Tanzania; and locally important as a source of forest products for local people.  The ecosystem services provided by these forests to the people of Tanzania is estimated to be US$ 175 million per annum.  The forests are also an important reservoir and sink for greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.  Preventing deforestation in this area is therefore important in efforts to mitigate climate change.",
